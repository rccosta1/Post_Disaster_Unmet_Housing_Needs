# Post_Disaster_Unmet_Housing_Needs
A Python script to estimate post-disaster unmet housing needs in the US

The main file is called 2017_Fires_Unmet_Needs.ipynb. This is a Google colab notebook. To use it, you will have to modify the pathing to direct the notebook to the files on your computer. Instruction on each cell is provided in the notebook. For minor assistance, e-mail rodrigo.costa@waterloo.ca. However, I will limit assistance to questions regarding the methodology/implementation but due to a limited bandwidth will not answer python/colab-related questions.
